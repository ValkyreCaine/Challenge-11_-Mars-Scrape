# Challenge-11_-Mars-Scrape

Hello there, creatures from earth! I'm just kidding, though I did have fun naming everything after Marvin the Martian!

This is my Mars Scrape challenge for module 11. You will find everything you need in the main repo. This includes the jupyter notebooks for both part 1 and part 2 as well as the martian weather csv file made form the dataframe I created in part 2.

All code was as always created by me and troubleshooted by the lovely class AI tool.

Please let me know if you have any questions or run into any issues. 

Thank you!
